## Overview

I’m a **Computer Engineering student** focused on building a strong and practical understanding of  
**computer science fundamentals**, **Linux-based systems**, and **security-oriented backend development**.

I deliberately prioritize **correctness, clarity, and maintainability** over rapid or trend-driven solutions.  
My long-term goal is to design systems that are *predictable, debuggable, and secure by design*.

## Core Interests

- Backend and systems engineering
- Linux internals and administration
- Networking and security engineering
- Mathematics and theoretical CS foundations
- Clean architecture and long-term software quality

---

## Technical Profile

### Programming
- **Python** — backend development, automation
- **C / C++** — systems-level concepts, memory & performance awareness
- **Bash** — scripting and CLI automation
- **C#** — general-purpose development

### Backend & Data
- Django (architecture-focused usage)
- RESTful APIs
- PostgreSQL
- Authentication & authorization mechanisms

### Systems, Networking & Security
- Daily **Arch Linux** user (CLI-first workflow)
- Linux system administration (**LPIC-1**)
- Networking fundamentals (**MTCNA**, CCNA-level concepts)
- Security foundations (**Security+**, CEH track)
- Firewalling, access control, and system hardening concepts

## Current Focus

- Designing **security-aware backend systems** with Django
- Strengthening understanding of:
  - Operating systems
  - Networking & security engineering
  - Low-level and systems concepts
- Building **Linux-centric, CLI-first tools**
- Translating theory into practical, production-minded code

---

## Direction

- Grow into a **backend & systems engineer**
- Build practical tooling for **networking and security**
- Contribute to **infrastructure-level open-source projects**
- Maintain a strong balance between **theory and implementation**
